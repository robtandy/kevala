</p>

kevala runs System 1 decision models, [Laya](https://huggingface.co/convaiinnovations/laya) and
[Kev](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/kev) today, inside the browser. You give it a piece of text or
JSON and typed questions (`noul` for yes/no, `choice`, `score`), and it returns a probability for
every option of every question in one forward pass. There is no model server, no API key, and no
data leaving the tab.

The engine is Rust with zero dependencies, compiled to WebAssembly, plus WebGPU kernels written for
these models. The browser runtime is a few plain ES modules. The first load downloads a pinned int8
pack of the model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/bvolpato/kevala-packs) and keeps it in
the browser, so there is nothing to host. If the pack is unreachable, kevala converts the original
checkpoint in the browser instead.

## Quick start

From a CDN, in any page:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { Kevala } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/kevala@latest/js/src/index.js";

  const kevala = await Kevala.load({ model: "laya", onProgress: console.log });
  const r = await kevala.decide("We were billed twice. Refund the duplicate today or we cancel.", {
    team: { type: "choice", instructions: "Which team should handle this?",
            criteria: { billing: "invoices, payments, refunds", technical: "bugs, outages", other: "anything else" } },
    churn: { type: "noul", instructions: "Does the customer threaten to leave?" },
  });
  console.log(r.answers.team.choice, r.answers.churn.noul); // "billing" 0.87
</script>
```

Or install from the npm registry with pnpm, with any bundler (Vite, webpack, esbuild) or none:

```sh
pnpm add kevala
```

```js
import { Kevala } from "kevala";
```

Building with a coding agent? The site has [a prompt to paste into it](https://bvolpato.github.io/kevala/#/home/agent),
and [`skills/kevala/SKILL.md`](skills/kevala/SKILL.md) is the same guide as an agent skill.

The first visit downloads the model's int8 pack from Hugging Face (Laya: 479 MB). It is stored in the
site's Origin Private File System, so later visits load in under a second. It works from any origin
and needs no special headers. To load the original weights and convert them in the browser instead,
pass `from: "checkpoint"`; to serve the weights yourself, pass the URL of a `.kevala` file. See
[Packs](docs/packs.md) for both, and for how the packs are made and published.

## Models

| name | family | backbone | head | first download | stored pack |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `laya` | `laya` | ModernBERT-large encoder (28 layers) | 2-layer transformer + marker scorer + act head | about 850 MB | 479 MB |
| `kev-0.8b` | `kev` | Qwen3.5-0.8B decoder (18 Gated DeltaNet + 6 gated attention layers), Kev's LoRA merged | pointer head | about 1.6 GB | 857 MB |

Pick with `Kevala.load({ model: "kev-0.8b" })`, or pass the URL of a `.kevala` pack you host. Families are
pluggable: see [Adding a model family](docs/adding-a-model.md).

## Speed

On an Apple M4 Max, with WebGPU in Chrome:

| | Laya | Kev-0.8B |
|---|---:|---:|
| short request (one question, 30 to 45 tokens) | **11 ms** | **11 ms** |
| the same state asked again (cache hit) | | **10 ms** |

Laya scores 32 states in one pass in 186 ms, and Kev answers a 533-token state in 116 ms. Without
WebGPU, a short request takes about 0.4 s on one CPU core. The Playground's Profile tab (or
`kevala.profile(true)`) shows the time of every GPU kernel for any request. [`bench.html`](https://bvolpato.github.io/kevala/bench.html) measures your own machine.

Kev reuses its KV cache: all questions about a state share one pass over it, and the carries of recent
states stay resident, so a repeated state only runs its question tokens and a state that extends a
cached one (a growing conversation) only runs its new tokens. Laya is a bidirectional encoder, where a KV
cache is impossible; it packs every question of a request into one pass instead.

## Fidelity

Every number is checked against the upstream PyTorch code (`tools/golden.py` runs the `laya` SDK,
`tools/golden_kev.py` runs Kev's own code), natively and in the browser.

| | token ids | argmax agreement | max probability difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Laya, f32 weights | 41 / 41 exact | 41 / 41 | < 0.0001 |
| Laya, int8 pack (CPU, WebAssembly, WebGPU) | 41 / 41 exact | 41 / 41 | 0.024 |
| Kev-0.8B, int8 pack (CPU, WebAssembly, WebGPU) | 8 / 8 requests exact | 13 / 13 | 0.0097 |

The tokenizers also match the Hugging Face `tokenizers` library on the fixture corpora and on about
ten million fuzzed strings. Open [`parity.html`](https://bvolpato.github.io/kevala/parity.html) to rerun the Laya check in
your own browser.

## Demos and examples

- [Playground](https://bvolpato.github.io/kevala/#/playground): any state, any questions, any model
  and backend, with the response as highlighted JSON and the code to reproduce it.
- [Tetris](https://bvolpato.github.io/kevala/#/tetris): the model plays. When a piece appears, code
  lists every spot it can land in and describes each outcome in words; the model scores them all in
  one batched pass, and the piece presses the keys (turn, left, right, drop) toward the best one.
- [Chess](https://bvolpato.github.io/kevala/#/chess): play the shared classifier as White or Black,
  watch classifier self-play, or play locally with no model download. Code describes the immediate
  outcome of every legal move; `decideMany` scores them and the highest P(good move) plays.
  These are classifier scores, not win probabilities or a strong chess engine. Includes special
  moves, move history, undo, flip and pause; repetition and fifty-move draws are automatic.
- [Guardrail](https://bvolpato.github.io/kevala/#/guardrail): a prompt-injection and jailbreak gate in
  front of an LLM that acts on confident answers and escalates the unsure ones.
- [Inbox](https://bvolpato.github.io/kevala/#/inbox): triage a mailbox, with rows filling in as each
  batch of answers returns.
- [`examples/`](examples/): complete single-file pages you can copy into a site: a minimal page, a
  comment form that blocks toxic posts, an LLM cascade that escalates only the unsure cases, a game
  loop.
- [`skills/kevala/SKILL.md`](skills/kevala/SKILL.md): teaches a coding agent to add kevala to a site.

## API

```js
import { Kevala, MODELS, cacheInfo, clearCache } from "kevala";

const kevala = await Kevala.load({
  model: "laya",         // a MODELS name, a .kevala URL, or an ArrayBuffer/Blob
  backend: "auto",       // "webgpu", "wasm", or "auto" (WebGPU, then CPU if GPU loading fails)
  onPage: false,         // run on the page, not in a worker (automatic when only pages get WebGPU)
  threads: 8,            // WebAssembly workers for the CPU backend
  submit: "await",       // GPU chunks: "await" favors responsiveness; "split" reduces queue waits
  from: "pack",          // "pack": the pinned int8 pack; "checkpoint": convert the original weights
  cache: true,           // keep the pack in origin storage
  onProgress: (p) => {}, // { phase: download | convert | cache | init | warmup, loaded, total }
  signal,                // AbortSignal
  plugins: [],           // URLs of extra architecture plugins
});

await kevala.decide(state, questions, { parts });  // one request, one forward pass
await kevala.decideMany([{ state, questions }]);   // many states, still one pass
kevala.info;      // { arch, backend, gpu, gpuPowerPreference, gpuUnavailable, threads, modalities, model, config, pack, loadMs }
await kevala.profile(true); // later responses carry timing.gpu: milliseconds per GPU kernel
kevala.dispose();
```

Questions use the System One request shape (`type`, `instructions`, `criteria`), and each family
answers in its own reference format: Laya like `laya` 0.3.5 (`action.act_probability`, 4 decimals),
Kev like `kev.serve` (2 decimals, plus `raw_probabilities` at full precision). For starting points,
`import { presets } from "kevala"` has the `laya` SDK's question sets for triage, email,
guardrails, moderation and routing.

Requests may carry typed `parts` (`{ type: "text", text }`; `image` and `audio` for packs whose
`info.modalities` list them). A part the model cannot read is an error, never silently dropped.

Server side, the same engine runs in Node.js, Deno or Bun without workers or a GPU:

```js
import { loadFile } from "kevala/node";
const kevala = await loadFile("laya-q8.kevala");
kevala.decide("I want my money back.", { refund: { type: "noul", instructions: "Does the customer ask for money back?" } });
```

## How it works

```
page ─► index.js ─► engine worker ─► coordinator (Rust → WebAssembly): tokenizer, template, embeddings, head
                         ├─► WebGPU trunk: int8 matmul (split-K), attention, Gated DeltaNet, norms
                         └─► WebAssembly shard workers: tensor-parallel layers, no SharedArrayBuffer needed
```

- **One Rust core, zero crates.** JSON, Unicode tables, byte-level BPE tokenizers, the request
  templates, both model families, the `.kevala` pack format and the checkpoint converters (safetensors,
  LoRA adapters, `torch.save` files) are all in `crates/kevala`, and the same code runs natively for the
  CLI and tests.
- **GPU kernels in the crate too.** WebGPU only runs WGSL, so the kernels are `.wgsl` sources in
  `crates/kevala/src/wgsl`, specialized by Rust (f16 tiles, tile rows for the input length, subgroup
  variants) and served by the WebAssembly binary. The JavaScript only builds pipelines and dispatches.
- **`.kevala` packs** hold int8 weights with a scale per 32 weights, 64-byte aligned, and can be split
  while they stream: the coordinator, the GPU and each CPU shard receive only the bytes they keep.
- **Pluggable families.** A pack's `config.arch` picks a family from a registry in Rust and an
  architecture plugin in JavaScript. Each family owns its template, backbone and head, and declares its
  modalities.

## Command line and building from source

Use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) for development. `package.json` pins pnpm 12.5.1
and Node.js 24.21.0 LTS. `pnpm install` downloads the project Node runtime, and pnpm scripts
use it automatically. CI uses the same pins and requires the committed lockfile.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm check                                  # JavaScript syntax
pnpm test                                   # JavaScript regression tests
pnpm build                                  # js/src/kevala-{relaxed,simd,base}.wasm
cargo build --release -p kevala-cli            # target/release/kevala

kevala convert <laya-checkpoint-dir> -o laya-q8.kevala
kevala convert-kev --base <qwen3.5-dir> --kev <kev-dir> -o kev-0.8b-q8.kevala   # see docs/packs.md
kevala decide laya-q8.kevala --state "..." --questions '{"q": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "..."}}'
kevala parity laya-q8.kevala tests/fixtures/golden.json
kevala bench kev-0.8b-q8.kevala --tokens 128
kevala wgsl matmul --f16 --rows 3                  # a GPU kernel, specialized

pnpm serve                                 # static server at http://127.0.0.1:8080
uv run dev/smoke-chess.py --channel chrome   # Chess browser checks against that server; no model download
uv run dev/record-tetris.py                  # re-record docs/tetris.gif and docs/tetris.mp4 (needs port 8123)
cargo test --release                         # Rust tests (tokenizer, sequence and cache tests skip without their files)
```

The core needs Rust 1.85 or newer. Python helpers generate reference fixtures and automate
browser GPU benchmarks through `uv`.

With `pnpm serve` running in another terminal, the Chess browser check uses installed Chrome
in an isolated, headless context and a stub classifier. It covers local play, special moves,
keyboard and mobile focus, model lifecycle, responsive layouts and switching to Tetris;
it does not validate real model inference. Use
`--url http://127.0.0.1:PORT` for another server, or omit `--channel chrome` after installing
Playwright Chromium with `uv run --with playwright python -m playwright install chromium`.

For reproducible GPU timing, model parity checks, and Firefox/Linux measurements, see
[docs/gpu-benchmarks.md](docs/gpu-benchmarks.md). The benchmark distinguishes GPU kernel time
from end-to-end browser latency.

## Limits

- First visits are heavy: a 479 MB pack for Laya, 857 MB for Kev. Later visits read it from disk.
  You can also convert once with the CLI and serve the pack from your own host.
- Without WebGPU, a request takes about a second on a fast laptop core, more on phones. Laya splits
  across CPU workers; Kev runs in one instance on the CPU for now.
- Browser backgrounding throttles CPU work: benchmarks from a hidden tab are several times slower.
- WebGPU was verified on Apple Silicon in Chromium, with every optional feature and without any
  (the default limits, as the weakest WebGPU device has). Every kernel also passes naga, the WGSL
  compiler Firefox uses. This Linux kernel sweep validates Firefox 152 on both NVIDIA and AMD,
  with all 41 Laya and 13 Kev reference decisions matching. See the benchmark report for the
  measured features, numerical limits, and performance results.
- GPU loading first requests the high-performance adapter, then retries with a low-power preference
  if GPU initialization fails. The browser chooses the adapter and may return the same GPU twice.
  `kevala.info.gpuPowerPreference` reports the successful preference. In `auto` mode, failures during
  allocation, shader compilation or warmup fall back to the CPU; `backend: "webgpu"` reports an error
  if both GPU attempts fail. `kevala.info.gpuUnavailable` preserves the failures when Auto uses the CPU.
- int8 weights and GPU arithmetic move probabilities by about 0.024 (Laya) and 0.010 (Kev)
  on the tested fixtures and Linux GPUs, with no argmax changes. The benchmark report gives
  exact errors, including the f32 path's inherited precision edge. The models themselves have
  their own limits: see the
  [Laya](https://huggingface.co/convaiinnovations/laya) and [Kev](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/kev)
  model cards before trusting a threshold.
- Requests can carry image and audio parts, but no shipped pack reads them yet.

On Linux, Firefox's WebGPU backend uses [Vulkan](https://searchfox.org/firefox-main/source/gfx/wgpu_bindings/Cargo.toml),
not CUDA. Check the WebGPU entries in `about:support` and the GPU's available memory when a load
fails. `Buffer with '' label is invalid` can be a later symptom of a failed allocation; Kevala now
captures allocation errors while uploading weights and initializing kernels. Free GPU memory by
closing other GPU-heavy applications, then retry. Browser storage caching saves the download but
does not reduce the GPU memory needed to load the model. Firefox Linux support also depends on the
browser channel and settings; see Mozilla's [WebGPU support notes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Experimental_features#webgpu_api).
